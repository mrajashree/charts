# Backup-Restore-Operator Chart

The `backup-restore-operator` provides ability to back up and restore Kubernetes cluster metadata generated by user applications 

### Components

This chart installs the following clusterscoped CRDs  

* **Backup**  
  Creating an instance of the Backup CRD lets you perform a backup. A Backup CR must specify a ResourceSet, that contains a set of selectors to target certain resources/CRDs. (docs link TBD)
* **Restore**  
  Creating an instance of the Restore CRD lets you restore from a backup file. (docs link TBD)
* **ResourceSet**  
  ResourceSet CR should contain a set of selectors for all Kubernetes resources and CRDs that your application installs and manages, so that the operator can gather them during backups (docs link TBD)


### User flow

1. This chart can be configured to save all the backups at a particular location, such as s3/minio bucket, or in a Kubernetes Persistent Volume.
2. The Backup CR must refer a ResouceSet, and the operator will collect and save resources that match its ResourceSet
3. [This](linkTBD) is the ResourceSet that selects all resources installed by Rancher in the management cluster
The chart will add this ResourceSet in the cluster during installation
4. User can choose to encrypt resources before saving them in the backup (docs link TBD)
5. For restore, user must specify the exact tarball filename that contains the backup data.


### Installation
```
helm install backup-restore-operator rancher/stable
